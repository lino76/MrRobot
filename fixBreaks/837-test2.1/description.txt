Security violation
The server does not follow the trust transitivity rule. If I create
a transitivity rule and then delete the permission paths for a read
right, it does not remove the read permission if I delete a path that
occurs before it. So if x->y->z, and I delete x->y, z still has access
although it shouldn't.
Actual result: program succeeds
Expected result : DENIED
