BUG: 
When delegating permission to a variable from SUser to RUser, the database doesn't save the origin of the permission (SUser).
That way it is impossible to check whether the permission chain to RUser is still valid.
This allows making circles for example bob can inherit read permission from himself on a variable 
he doesn't own if admin executes "set delegation x bob read->bob".
According to the Specs this is not a valid delegation assertions which would allow bob to read x.
