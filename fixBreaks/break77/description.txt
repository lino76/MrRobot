* Circular delegations no properly checked.

According to the specification, a principal p has right r on x if there exists
some q that has right r on x and a delegation assertion x q r -> p exists. This
is not the case if a circular delegation is defined for variable x (bob ->
alice, alice -> bob), so the program should be denied access. Instead, the
program successfully runs.
