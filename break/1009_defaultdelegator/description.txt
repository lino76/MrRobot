admin, create bob, create x, x write -> bob
admin, create john, x admin read -> john
admin, set default delegator to bob (bob does not have delegate)
admin, create jill
jill, write x (jill does not inherit bobs rights as per mike H)
john, read x (permissions should stay same)


Giving bob write permission is not sufficient. Bob needs to have delegate permission to delegate his write permission to someone else. Just because you made Bob the default delegator does not give him delegate permission on all variables. When new principals are created, Bob delegates permission to them for the variables that he has delegate permission on.
